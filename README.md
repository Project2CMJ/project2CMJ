# Project 2 - Real-Life Client - SELECT NUTRITION

Project 2 is our first opportunity to show employers what we are capable of. Our team was fortunate enough to not only create and deploy a unique and interactive full-stack application, but we were able to aply our newly learned skills to a real-life situation.

Our very first client was in need of a site for her newly opened shake/donut shop and we threw our hat in the ring to accept the challenge of creating and design great user experience for her customers.

# Installation
No installation required! Just checkout the deployed application <a href="http://selectnutrition.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a>!

If you wanted to install this on your computer, see following steps below:
1. Copy the clone link of the repository from GitHub
2. Open Bash or Terminal Window
3. When the console opens, navigate to the directory the repository will be added to
4. In the console, type the command "git clone" and paste the link to repository
5. Open repository in preferred code editor
6. Open terminal in code editor
7. Type in terminal "npm init -y" to install dependency packages needed

  Ensure the following packages are installed
- npm init -y
- npm install dotenv
- npm install express-handlebars
- npm install MySQL
- npm install sequelize


# Usage
1. After repository has been cloned, in the terminal, log in to MySQL by entering: mysql -u root -p and enter your password when prompted
2. Using MySQL run the schema.sql by typing: source schema.sql. This will create the database needed for this application
3. Quit MySQL by typing: \q
4. Run seed by typing: npm run seed
5. Start the app by running command: node server.js

## User Story (provided in the project 2 instructions)
```
As a group, you will use everything you’ve learned over the past six units to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers.
```
## Acceptance Criteria (provided in project 2 instructions)
```
Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.
Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
Have a polished UI.
Be responsive.
Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```
